# GiLA

GiLA is a visualization tool which analyzes the labels used in GitHub projects. The tool provides three simple yet powerful visualizations

* **Label usage**. Visualize the labels used in your GitHub project, their frequency and how they relate to each other
* **User involvement**. Discover the most active users and contributors per label: who opens them? who closes them?
* **Label timeline**. Understand the typical evolution of issues under each label: when are they discussed?, solved?, etc.

## Using the tool

The tool is available at [http://atlanmod.github.io/gila](http://atlanmod.github.io/gila).

You can also access **directly to the results webpage** by calling the URL:

`http://atlanmod.github.io/gila/project.html?projectName=USER/REPO`

where

* *USER* is the GitHub login of the user owing the repository
* *REPO* is the name of the repository

or if you know the **identifier of your project**, you can even call:

`http://atlanmod.github.io/gila/project.html?projectId=ID`

where

* *ID* is the GitHub identifier of your project

## What is comming next?

We are exploring other ways to mine the information behind the labels of your project. We would like to study other appealing visualizations to help developers to manage projects.

If you have any recommendation, just contact us.
